## 🚀 The Creation Process

### 1. The Spark (Input)
Genesis requires only a seed to grow a forest. But the more you give, the more unique the bloom.

- **Title**: The name of your legend.
- **Description**: The soul of your story. Don't just say "a dog"; say *"A courageous golden retriever named Max who discovers he can speak to squirrels in 19th century London."*
- **Audience**: Who is this for? *Toddlers? PhD Students? Sci-Fi Fanatics?*
- **Style**: Choose from our **Curated Artistic Presets** (Watercolor, Cyberpunk, Pixar-3D, Noir, and more).

### 2. The Alchemy (AI Generation)
Once you hit **"Generate"**, the magic begins.
- **Narrative Weaving**: Our LLM (Gemini Pro) constructs a compelling narrative arc.
- **Visual Synthesis**: Each page gets a custom-generated illustration that perfectly matches the text.
- **Layout Composition**: Text and image are balanced for optimal reading flow.

### 3. The Polish (Editing & Refinement)
You are the director.
- **Remix Studio**: Don't like an image? Regenerate it with a click.
- **Text Editor**: Tweak the prose, add dialogue, or rewrite entire chapters.
- **Voice Tuning**: Adjust how the **Voice Tutor** narrates your book.
